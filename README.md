Densest Subgraph implementation for COMAD 2014
==============================================

Compiling
---------

Just use `make`.

Running
-------

For testing the algorithms use one of the graphs published at the [SNAP website](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html). We propose 3 different solutions for the Densest Subgraph problem; all can be tested in the same way, using their respective executable:

	./CharikarBatch graph_file

	./Goldberg graph_file

	./GoldbergBatch graph_file
